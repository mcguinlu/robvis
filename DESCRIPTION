Description: Helps users in quickly visualizing risk-of-bias
    assessments performed as part of a systematic review. It allows users to
    create weighted bar-plots of the distribution of risk-of-bias judgments
    within each bias domain, in addition to traffic-light plots of the
    specific domain-level judgments for each study. The resulting figures are
    of publication quality and are formatted according the risk-of-bias
    assessment tool use to perform the assessments. Currently, the supported
    tools are ROB2.0 (for randomized controlled trials; Sterne et al (2019)
    <doi:10.1136/bmj.l4898>), ROBINS-I (for non-randomised studies of
    interventions; Sterne (2016) <doi:10.1136/bmj.i4919>), and Quality &
    Applicability of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies V2 (Whiting et al (2011)
    <doi:10.7326/0003-4819-155-8-201110180-00009>).
