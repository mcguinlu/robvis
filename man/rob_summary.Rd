\title{Produce summary weighted barplots of risk-of-bias assessments.}
\usage{
rob_summary(data, tool, overall = FALSE, weighted = TRUE,
  colour = "cochrane", columns = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing summary (domain) level risk-of-bias assessments, with the first column containing the study details, the second column containing the first domain of your assessments, and the final column containing a weight to assign to each study. The function assumes that the data includes a column for overall risk-of-bias. For example, a ROB2.0 dataset would have 8 columns (1 for study details, 5 for domain level judgements, 1 for overall judgements, and 1 for weights, in that order).}

\item{tool}{The risk of bias assessment tool used. RoB2.0 (tool="ROB2"), ROBINS-I (tool="ROBINS-I"), and QUADAS-2 (tool="QUADAS-2") are currently supported.}

\item{overall}{An option to include a bar for overall risk-of-bias in the figure. Default is FALSE.}

\item{weighted}{An option to specify whether weights should be used in the barplot. Default is TRUE, in line with current Cochrane Collaboration guidance.}

\item{colour}{An argument to specify the colour scheme for the plot. Default is "cochrane" which used the ubiquitous Cochrane colours, while a preset option for a colour-blind friendly palette is also available (colour = "colourblind").}

\item{quiet}{An option to quietly produce and save the plot without it displaying in R/Rstudio.}
}
\value{
Risk of bias assessment barplot figure.
}
\description{
A function to convert standard risk-of-bias output to tidy data and plot a summary barplot.
